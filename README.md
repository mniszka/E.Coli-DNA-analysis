# E.Coli-DNA-analysis

E. coli DNA analysis using Python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries

genome data package from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
DNA sequence is stored in FASTA file

- loading data
- data preprocessing
- counting nucleotides
- Analyzing the composition in different regions of the DNA sequence (coding vs. non-coding)
- Analyzing the frequency of each codon (a sequence of three nucleotides) in the coding regions to understand codon usage bias in E. coli.
